## Loading and processing the data
**Load the data into R object "data".**
Since we don't need to work with "NA"s in the first several questions, I'll omit them in the data for now and create another object "data1" for it.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
unzip("repdata-data-activity.zip")
data<-read.csv("activity.csv")
data1<-na.omit(data)
```

##What is the mean total number of steps taken per day?
**Calculate the total number of steps taken each day.**

```{r, echo=TRUE}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
by_day <- group_by(data1, date)
sum_by_day <- summarise(by_day, sum(steps))
colnames(sum_by_day) <- c("date", "steps")
```

**Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day.**

```{r,echo=TRUE}
qplot(steps, data=sum_by_day, geom="histogram")
```

**Calculate and report the _mean_ and _median_ total number of step taken per day.**
```{r,echo=TRUE}
summarise(sum_by_day, mean(steps), median(steps))
```

##What is the average daily activity pattern?
**Make a time series plot of the 5-minute interval and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days.**
I use qplot for this purpose.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
by_interval <- group_by(data1, interval)
sum_by_interval <- summarise(by_interval, mean(steps))
colnames(sum_by_interval) <- c("interval", "mean_steps")
qplot(interval, mean_steps, data=sum_by_interval, geom="line", xlab="5-minutes Interval", ylab="Average number of steps taken")
```

**Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, contains the maximum number of steps?**
I use "order" function to find the row index containing the maximum number of steps, and the subset the value of "interval" from that row.

```{r,echo=TRUE}
sum_by_interval[order(sum_by_interval$mean_steps, decreasing=T)[1],1]
```

##Imputing missing values
From now on I'll start using the "data" object.
**Calculate and report the total number of missing values in the dataset.**
I use !compete.cases() to count missing values.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
sum(!complete.cases(data))
```

**Devise a strategy for filing in all of the missing values in the dataset.**
I'll use the average number of steps taken in each time interval over all the days to replace these NA values. 

**Create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the missing data filled in.**
We already have a dataframe for the replacement, which is ```{r}sum_by_interval```. Now I want to replace the missing values according to this dataframe using a for loop. The results are stored in object "data2".

```{r, echo=TRUE}
data2<-data
for (i in 1:nrow(data2)){
        if (is.na(data2[i,1])){
                data2[i,1] <- sum_by_interval[match(data$interval[i],sum_by_interval$interval),2]
        }
}           
```

**Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day and Calculate and reprot the _mean_ and _median_ total number of steps taken perday.**
Same as the beginning of the project, with new data.

```{r,echo=TRUE}
by_day2 <- group_by(data2, date)
sum_by_day2 <- summarise(by_day2, sum(steps))
colnames(sum_by_day2) <- c("date", "steps")
qplot(steps, data=sum_by_day2, geom="histogram")
summarise(sum_by_day2, mean(steps), median(steps))
```

##Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?

**Create a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels -- "weekday" and "weekend" indicating whether a given date is a weekday or weekend day.**

```{r,echo=TRUE}
data1$date <- as.Date(data1$date, "%Y-%m-%d")
data1$day <- weekdays(data1$date)
data1$day_type<- "weekday"
data1$day_type[data1$day %in% c("Saturday","Sunday")] <- "weekend"
```

**Make a panel plot containing a time series plot (i.e. type = "l") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all weekday days or weekend days (y-axis).**

```{r,echo=TRUE}
data1$interval<-as.factor(data1$interval)
data1$day_type<-as.factor(data1$day_type)
TotSteps3 <- aggregate(data1[1],by=data1[c(3,5)],FUN=mean)
qplot(interval,steps,data=TotSteps3)+geom_line()+facet_wrap(~day_type,nrow=2)
```
